php-news-poster
===============

A simple system that can be used to post news to your website.

Requires php and mysql, nothing else. As lightweight as it gets. Simple concise code so it can be adapted to any needs.

This project is at the most basic level a database that stores posts and a few pages to manage the posts.
The implementation of displaying posts on the site is left to the user. Not forcing anyone to change their sites
around the project.
